A strictly binary tree, also known as a full binary tree or proper binary tree, is a type of binary tree in which every node has either exactly two children or none (i.e., each node is either an internal node with two children or a leaf node with no children). 
Assume that for a strictly binary tree with k leaves, the total number of nodes is 
2kâˆ’1. Now, consider a strictly binary tree with k+1 leaves.

In a strictly binary tree, every internal node has exactly two children. To increase the number of leaves from k to 
k+1, we can select an existing leaf node and add two child nodes to it. 
This transforms the selected leaf into an internal node with two children, effectively adding two new nodes to the tree.
By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all 
nâ‰¥1: a strictly binary tree with 
n leaves always contains 2nâˆ’1 nodes.


it takes t[2n] memory bc t[0] is useless

///////////////////////////

below we are just creating a binary tree with n leaves, -> number of extra nodes = n 

                                                      1: [0, 16) r

                                2: [0, 8) l                                                  3: [8, 16) r

            4: [0, 4) l                     5: [4, 8) r                          6: [8, 12) l                        7: [12, 16) r

  8: [0, 2) l        9: [2, 4) r       10: [4, 6)      11: [6, 8)          12: [8, 10)      13: [10, 12)        14: [12, 14)       15: [14, 16)

16: 0   17: 1   18: 2   19: 3   20: 4 l   21: 5 r      22: 6   23: 7     24: 8   25: 9      26: 10  27: 11     28: 12   29: 13     30: 14   31: 15

we consider range [L, R+1)

 we go in left to Right direction from node L, and right to left direction from node R+1

 i.e.  L -------->...        mid      ...<------------R+1
      type 1                               type2
 during this process, when going from L to mid
if we are at node type 'r'(right node), that means it is fully in range, take it and increase L++, then L/=2

similarly when going from R + 1 to mid, 
 if we are at node type 'r'(right node), that means the left node is fully in range, so we take left node, then R/=2 which is basically the same as R-1/2

 General idea is the following. 
 If l, the left interval border, is odd (which is equivalent to l&1) then l is the right child of its parent. 
 Then our interval includes node l but doesn't include it's parent. 
 So we add t[l] and move to the right of l's parent by setting lâ€‰=â€‰(lâ€‰+â€‰1)â€‰/â€‰2. 
If l is even, it is the left child, and the interval includes its parent as well (unless the right border interferes), 
so we just move to it by setting lâ€‰=â€‰lâ€‰/â€‰2. Similar argumentation is applied to the right border. 
We stop once borders meet.

const int N = 1e5;  // limit for array size

int t[2 * N];

int query(int l, int r) // sum on interval [l, r) remember we are excluding r
{
    int res = 0;
    for (l += n, r += n; l < r; l >>= 1, r >>= 1)

  build();
  modify(0, 1);
  printf("%d\n", query(3, 11));
  return 0;
}




Some people begin to struggle and invent something too complex when the operations are inverted, for example:

1) add a value to all elements in some interval; ofcourse everything is 0 initially dumbass
2) compute an element at some position.
But all we need to do in this case is to switch the code in methods modify and query as follows:

void modify(int l, int r, int value) {
  for (l += n, r += n; l < r; l >>= 1, r >>= 1) {
    if (l&1) t[l++] += value;
    if (r&1) t[--r] += value;
  }
}

int query(int p) {
  int res = 0;
  for (p += n; p > 0; p >>= 1) res += t[p];
  return res;
}

This entry explains for Assigment in range, sum in range â€” and it is difficult than increment operation.
But, If you want increment in range, it simple than assignment.
Let Theory, again; 1<=n<=N ~ 10^5. a[0], a[1], ... , a[n-1] â€” given array. Need apply two operations:
increment a[L], a[L+1],... a[R-1] to value, i.e [L..R) range.
find sum a[L] + a[L+1] + ... + a[R-1] , i.e. [L..R) range.
t[0..n+n] â€” segment tree array. d[0..n+n] â€” lazy propogation.
where
t[i] = a[ i â€” n], n<=i < n+n. and
t[i] = t[i*2] + t[i*2+1], for 0<=i<n.
If a[i] incremented by value, so t[i+n] also incremented by value.
if t[i*2] and t[i*2+1] incremented by value, they root t[i] incremented 2* value. and its applied recursive down.

In general, if all leaf nodes of i-th root incremented by value, so t[i] should increment the value multiply number of leaf children of i-th root.
for example: n = 8. if a[4] , a[5], a[6], a[7] increment by 5, so t[12], t[13], t[14], t[15] incremented by 1*5, t[6], and t[7] â€” incremented by 2*5, and t[3] incremented by 4*5. t[3] â€” has 4 children.

Now, about lazy propogation d[] array. d[ i ] == 0, means there no increment operation i-th root. d[i] > 0, means all leaf nodes from i-th root of segment tree will increment by d[i], and applied 2.step operation recursivily.
If we need increment [L..R)  range by `value` , need increment only root nodes by  `value` * children(i), and d[i] increments by `value`.  Other nodes will calculated some later.
For example: if need increment a[4..7] to 5. There only increment t[3] to 5*4, and put d[3] = 5. This apply operation. Other nodes t[6], t[7], t[12], t[13], t[14], t[15] nodes will incremented some later (may never).
